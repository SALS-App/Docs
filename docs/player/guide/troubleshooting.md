# Troubleshooting

For the most common problems, a solution could be found on the [Troubleshooting](/player/troubleshooting/) page. Most of the time the problem can be resolved be the user itself.

If you run into a problem, that is not on the Troubleshooting page, you can submit a Ticker in the [SALS Bugtracker](https://github.com/SALS-App/SALS). (A GitHub Account is required)
