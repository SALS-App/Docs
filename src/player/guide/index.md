#Introduction

SALS is a coustom launcher for ArmA 3. (Simple Arma Launcher and Syncer)

The Goal is to save users as much time as possible, without sacrificing complexity. Der Launcher hat einerseits die vertrauten Optionen, welche man schon aus dem normalen ArmA 3 Launcher kennt. The launcher has the familiar options from the vanilla launcher, furthermore the download path for the modpacks can be coustomized by the user, allowing installation on drives other than C: (for more on that, see [Settings](https://docs.sals-app.com/player/config/)). 

A core feature is the support for multiple modpacks. For example, a community has modpacks for cold war and WW2 szenarios. With SALS, the mods common to both packs only have to be downloaded once, saving capacity, time and bandwith. The user can easily switch between the modpacks with as little as two mouseclicks.
