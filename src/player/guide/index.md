# Introduction

SALS is a custom launcher for ArmA 3. (Simple Arma Launcher and Syncer)

The Goal is to save users as much time as possible, without sacrificing complexity. The launcher has the familiar options from the vanilla launcher, furthermore the download path for the Modsets can be customized by the user, allowing installation on drives other than C:/ (for more on that, see [Settings](/player/config)). 

A core feature is the support for multiple Modsets. For example, a community has Modets for cold war and WW2 szenarios. With SALS, the mods common to both packs only have to be downloaded once, saving capacity, time and bandwidth. The user can easily switch between the Modsets with as little as two mouseclicks.
